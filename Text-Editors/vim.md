# **`vim` Text Editor**  

The `vim` (Vi IMproved) editor is a powerful, highly configurable text editor used for programming and general text editing. It is an enhanced version of `vi`, offering more features like syntax highlighting, undo levels, and plugins.

  ```

- Open a file and jump to a specific line:  
  ```
  vim +10 file.txt
  ```

- Open multiple files:  
  ```
  vim file1.txt file2.txt

  (Use :n to go to the next file and :N to go to the previous file.)
