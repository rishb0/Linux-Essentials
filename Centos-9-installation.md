  Selecting the Installation Device  
  When you reach the Installation Destination screen:  
  - Local Standard Disks:  
    -  Displays the available storage devices (e.g., HDD, SSD)  
    -  Select the disk where CentOS will be installed by clicking the checkbox next to it  
  - Specialized Storage Devices (optional):  
    -  Used for network-attached storage (NAS) or advanced configurations like iSCSI

  Storage Configuration Options  
  After selecting a device, choose a storage configuration mode:  
  a) Automatic Partitioning  
    - The installer automatically creates default partitions:  
      -  /boot (for bootloader files)  
      -  swap (used for virtual memory)  
      -  / (root directory for the OS)  
    - Suitable for beginners or general-purpose installations
  
  b) Custom Partitioning  
    - Provides full control over partitioning, allowing manual definition of partitions and their sizes  
    - Steps:  
      1. Partition Scheme:  
         § Standard Partition: Traditional partitioning (no LVM)  
         § LVM (Logical Volume Manager): Allows resizing, snapshots  
         § LVM Thin Provisioning: Dynamically allocates storage  
      2. Create Partitions:  
         § Recommended scheme:  
           -  /boot → 1 GB (Standard Partition)  
           -  swap → 4 GB (Standard Partition)  
           -  / → Remaining space (Standard Partition)  
           -  File System: ext4 or XFS  
      3. Encrypt My Data:  
         § Option to encrypt partitions for security  
      4. Additional Space:  
         § Reclaim space from existing partitions if needed
